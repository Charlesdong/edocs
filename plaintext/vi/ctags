:h ctags

## basic usage
1. creat a tags file

    ctags *

2. open the tags file and i see the format is basiclly

    tagName <which file it belongs> <the line of the defination in this file>
<the type of this tag: f--function m--memner... see "$ ctags
--list-kinds|less" for more> <the class it belongs>

since the tags file only mark the position of the *defination*, so I doubt if
I can move to a call of the tag???

3. now I move the cursor to a tag name, CTRL-] will bring me to the defination
of the tag, and CTRL-T will take me back

4. *gd* and *CTRL-O* can be very useful here.
    NOTE: I accidently found *gd* works for Makefile as well, great!

## no enough feathers so I need cscope
according to http://ctags.sourceforge.net/ctags.html

    vi âˆ’t tag
    :ta tag
    Ctrl-]
    Ctrl-T

the above seems to be all I can do with ctags
then obviously cscope brings a lot more
