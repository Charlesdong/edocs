:h ctags

## basic usage
1. creat a tags file

    ctags *

2. open the tags file and i see the format is basiclly

    tagName <which file it belongs> <the line of the defination in this file>
<the type of this tag: f--function m--memner... see "$ ctags
--list-kinds|less" for more> <the class it belongs>

since the tags file only mark the position of the *defination*, so I doubt if
I can move to a call of the tag.???

3. now I move the cursor to a tag name, CTRL-] will bring me to the defination
of the tag, and CTRL-T will take me back

4. *gd* and *CTRL-O* can be very useful here.
