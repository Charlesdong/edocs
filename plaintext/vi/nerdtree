nerdtree helps me do navigation inside vim 

   1. when bash starts, the current dir is /home/peter
we just need to start vim here

   2. now start NerdTree, move cursor to *edocs*, and press *O*to open dirs
recursively.

   3. then I can */vim* to jump to my vim related files, it is much faster
then manually navigate to *edocs/plaintext/vim/*  

Now what if I want to add a new file?

   1. goto nerdtree window, move cursor to *edocs/plaintext/vi*(or any files
underneath), then *cd* to set CWD to *vi/*

   2. now I can use *vnew filename* to add a new file in the current dir *vi/*
 
   3. you can use *A* to maximize the nerdtree window
