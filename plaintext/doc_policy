I think it is not so good to write pre-mature stuff directly into muse
file, wasting lots of time tagging and formatting. 

I am considering switch form muse to gitbro/wiki/ for the reasons listed below:

1.	I move back to vim again
2.	muse takes a mode to write, while markdown doesnot
3.	nice to have a tree structure, then have 1000 files in muse/
4.	more power and flexibility on reorgnizing gitbro/wiki
5.	while I still have nice html output
