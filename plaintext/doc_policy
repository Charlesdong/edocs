I think it is not so good to write pre-mature stuff directly into muse
file, wasting lots of time tagging and formatting. 

So i create this plaintext/ and in the future, I will first put
stuff here. one topic one file, a few days later, if I find the
content in some file is really valuable, I will 
 
 1. get it formatted  
 2. put it into muse 
 3. add a link in the related index page

otherwise, I will just delete it.

another idea is even I do not do strict formatting here in this dir,
but I can still name the file with *.muse*, this way, when some times
I do want to add some simple format here to avoid confusion, I can use
muse short cuts. So why not?
