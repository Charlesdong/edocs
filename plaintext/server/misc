## set up git 

http://progit.org/book/ch4-1.html

the server side must be a bare repo

add  some code in `.git/hook/post-receive`

so that jekyll will do a updated on the site


## ssh 

    git clone peter@happypeter.org:repo.git

be sure to have `repo.git` in /home/peter/ rather than /var/www

anyway http is port80 while ssh is 22
