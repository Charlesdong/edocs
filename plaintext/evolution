is just like outlook

the nice thing to  have it is that I can bind my gmail account to it
, using it as a email client

configed according to https://help.ubuntu.com/community/UsingGmailWithEvolution
now I can click on a email-address on webpages and send email directly

##

but maybe light weight command line tools like fetchmail and sendmail are better for me
