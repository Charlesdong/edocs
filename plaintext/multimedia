my big headache now is that its so painful to make a screencast
since recordmydesktop fails to record audio for me, it is seems that
I need to config jack for it first.

the alternative is that I start a audio recorder and recordmydesktop 
syncly and merge the obtained vedio and audio tracks with ogmtools
but audacity has no commandline interface, bad bad bad!

## recordmydesktop

the sound works after I do:

	sudo apt-get install ardour

it make sense, since I see jack shows up several times during the installation
anyway it works on my ubuntu910+black dell	

but the error "Broken pipe: Overrun occurred." shows up all the time
some times it does not matter but some times it kills my audio. what to do?
