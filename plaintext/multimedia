my big headache now is that its so painful to make a screencast
since recordmydesktop fails to record audio for me, it is seems that
I need to config jack for it first.

the alternative is that I start a audio recorder and recordmydesktop 
syncly and merge the obtained vedio and audio tracks with ogmtools
but audacity has no commandline interface, bad bad bad!
