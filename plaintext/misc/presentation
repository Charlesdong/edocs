gitcast.com inspired me a lot

use a openoffice presentation, record my own explaination into a audio file
then make it into a screencast
so that I can share it with anybody without doing it again

## about the presentaion making

one tiny little bit of info at one time, otherwise people will be overwhelmed by
the complexity of your 50 blicks charta and losr their interst.
