## wget 

I finally installed xcode through the osx CD, and then

    sudo brew install wget
    # also works for tig markdown mplayer


## keycastr

I've heard good things about KeyCastr, but since there's no documentation I struggled a bit to get the keys to display onscreen. If you're having this issue be sure to enable access for assistive devices in the Universal Access pane of System Preferences.
