big headache of mine now is I do not know how to handle my private
data.

of course, revision history is also required, and git is for sure
chosen for this. 

** current states

 - as a separate repo independent form [[edocs]]
 - compressed and encryted with gpg
 - save the gpg file in [[dropbox]]
and the problem is:
 - no proper way to get the version of the gpgfile
