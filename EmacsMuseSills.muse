* here goes some basic tips

** pre
one thing I like best when I use MoinMoin is this
<example>
{{{
things or code I want to format shown unchanged
}}}
</example>

now I know I can also achieve this easily in muse.

<example>
M-x muse-insert-tag
</example>

but how I can get to know the keyboard short cut for it?
