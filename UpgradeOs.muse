** Mistake 
today I upgraded form 8.04 to 9.04, I chose
<example>
use entire disk
</example>
all my data gone, haha

** Simon 

 - have seperate partitions for /var and /home
 - use ext4, cause it is really faster

    * Update manager has a option to upgrade to higher version of the os, here is 8.10->9.04
    * ubuntu only support update form one version to its next one, no skip is allowed for security
