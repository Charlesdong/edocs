<example>
9.10 (Karmic) or later subscribers

The Ubuntu One software is pre-installed in 9.10 (Karmic) or later versions of Ubuntu so no download is needed. All that is left is to configure your computers to talk to Ubuntu One for synchronization.

   1. Go to Applications >> Internet and click Ubuntu One.
   2. If you are not already logged into Launchpad, you will be asked to do so.
   3. Click "Add your computer" in your web browser. 

Your computer will now synchronize files.

    * Using USB drives to move files between computers
    * Renaming files to keep a history of previous versions
    * Complicated backup software
    * FTP servers, system-specific sharing methods, Network Attached Storage (NAS)
