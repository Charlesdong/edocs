when my note-taking was in ***kdocs*** era, I always think about the question, that how can I get all the revisions of a
specific file.

Now I know ikiwikki can actually does the job, I need to find out how well it can work with EmacsMuse

then
 - git commit time will be the revision time
 - git log message will be the revision log 
 - and the history of the file will produce all the revisions
