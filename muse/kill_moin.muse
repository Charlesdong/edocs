** Kill Moin 

so I want a sh script to kill moni, since I always failed to kill its process with Ctl+c
A: that is because sent a signal(same as kill PID), which requires the process to handle it by itself. Well `kill -9` is "force quit"

now I need to know how to pass it to '''kill -9'''
A: use `xargs`

check what I used to kill [[virtualbox]] 
<example>
$ps aux | grep virtual | awk '{print $2}' | xargs kill -9     //kill virtualbox
</example>
