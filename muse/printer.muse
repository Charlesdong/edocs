HP Laserjet P1007

** now on a fresh ubuntu 9.04
type "hp+<tab>", then I see all hp printer commands already installed

so there is  no need to do 

apt-get install hplip

but you do need to install the driver, and due to the absence of pyQt or sth

the GUI installer will crash, afeter you type in the root passwd

but do not worry, there is text based installer available

all it takes is 

#hp-plugin -i

that is all, only one command, and everything is settled.
