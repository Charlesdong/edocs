easy explaination here

so I do not take notes for basic stuff about php

whenever i foget, I just go to w2school, and finish that doc in 5 mins

what is best here is the stuff is really easy, if you want to study
cookie or GET POST, you will suffer a  lot if you start with C, the
learning curve is much tender in PHP
