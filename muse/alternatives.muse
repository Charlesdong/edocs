a list of otherFormat->docbook convertors go here

** wiki text

This guy  invent his own tags, similar to moin, e.g
<example>
==How Does It Work?|how-does-it-work==
</example>

but I do not see a point for this.

why just use some mainline wiki format, though it might take a bit longer to

write, but there are wiki viewer and editor there which bring lots of convinience.
