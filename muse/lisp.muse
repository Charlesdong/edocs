auto file mode is nice, it is really what I should have, now I am in
auto-fill-mode an doing a test, it turns out beaufilly, the looking of
the page is no longer messy as before, and it is a minor mode, I can
simply add =(auto-fill-mode)= in my =.emacs= to achieve this without bad
effect on other functions.
