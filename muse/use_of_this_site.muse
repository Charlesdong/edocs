This site provides some index pages, but does not rely on that.

it is built as [[wiki]] 


And I always feel the **search box** is extremely useful

 e.g

 If I search =kernel=, then I will have all the pages with =kernel= as part of their name

 these pages have links to all my kernel related stuff

it is really fast to obtain what I want, and nothing can be lost


Eplog:

Actually I have some rules on how to organize things, which make this possible

see [[doc_format]]
