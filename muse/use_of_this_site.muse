here we provide some index page, but this site does not rely on these page

it is built as [[wiki]] 

And I always feel the serch box is extremely useful, e.g

If I search =kernel=, then I will have all the pages with =kernel= as part of their name

these pages have links to all my kernel related stuff

it is really fast to get what I want and nothing can be lost

Actually I have some rules on how to organize things, which make this possible

see [[doc_format]]
