see =man rsync=

<example>
              Note that rsync always verifies that each transferred  file  was
              correctly  reconstructed  on  the  receiving  side by checking a
              whole-file checksum that is generated  as  the  file  is  trans-
              ferred,  but  that automatic after-the-transfer verification has
              nothing to do with this option's before-the-transfer "Does  this
              file need to be updated?" check.
