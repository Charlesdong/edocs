for the beginning, I think I can go without IkiWiki, I do not need all my revisions so much

* Now

 - I think I can just use simple git command in emacs
 - as long as my data is save, I am OK
 - now I can run
<example>
C+x g .
</example>

to invoke ***git-cmd*** , since I already know git commands, so this is easy


 - now I bring GitHub in
