Sync your 1Password database

1Password is a password manager and auto-form-filler for the Mac that has been a hit among the Ars staff and readers alike. It's much more secure than the built-in OS X Keychain and lets you store tons of data, including credit cards, frequent flyer miles, addresses, phone numbersâ€”you name it, 1Password can store it. Then, with a simple keyboard command in most major browsers (command+ \), you can instantly log into any website or fill out any form without having to remember thousands of data snippets.
